This repository contains some pre-commit hooks that I use. More specifically:

pre-commit: allow to run multiple pre-commit hooks as specified in the script


pre-commit-default: the default git pre-commit hook checking eg. for trailing
                    whitespaces

pre-commit-compile: compile the project before committing and abort commit if
                    it fails
